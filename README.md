## Description

This application was originally a group project which I have now added features to improve the functionality and UI of the page. Some features I added includes making the page more aesthetically pleasing and adding more code to pages that were blank. I also added on a reviews page that contains sample reviews. I also created this readme which we were unable to add in our group project.

This application utilizes mySQl as well as other technologies which enable users to sign up and  login successfully. The application also gives users a glimpse of places they could potentially visit, once signed in. To view my additions to the page and add-ons I created, you can view in the screenshots below:
