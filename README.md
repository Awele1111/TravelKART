## Description

This application was originally a group project which I have now added features to improve the functionality and UI of the page. Some features I added includes making the page more aesthetically pleasing and adding more code to pages that were blank. I also added on a reviews page that contains sample reviews.

This application utilizes mySQl as well as other technologies which enable users to sign up and  login successfully. The application also gives users a glimpse get a glimpse of places they could potentially visit, once signed in. To view my additions to the page and addons I created, you can view in the screenshots below:

This first login page was created by my group for our project
